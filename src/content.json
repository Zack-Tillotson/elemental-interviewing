We explain the whole system from making a résumé to interviewing to the follow up.\n\nIt's easy to be confused and frustrated by what seems to be a broken system. You'll be asked to do strange tasks and answer weird questions, it can be overwelming.\n\nFortunately the whole process can be boiled down to answering three Elemental questions.\n\n### 1. Can you do the job?\nAre you technical capable of doing this job? Are you experienced enough? Can you learn the aspects of the job you don't already know?\n\nThis question is trying to ensure an employee has the experience and technical skills to do the job. Many candidates think this is the only thing they need to show in order to get a job, but it's just the first step!\n\n### 2. Will you do the job?\nAre you motivated and professional? Will you show up on time? Are you going to take a nap or surf the web instead of working?\n\nThis question is different from the first, it is asking about your motivation and professionalism. An employer wants to know that the person they're hiring has the right attitude.\n\n### 3. Are you annoying?\nAre we going to get along? How do you handle stress? Are you high maintinance? Do our personallities clash?\n\nEven the best candidate might not get an offer if you're not a fit in the company culture. There is nothing worse than being around someone who annoys you, you'll be together for 2,000+ hours every year so if they think you will annoy them they are not going to hire you.","topImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"4NFq5U9sOmyxVxLjAu7Ge1","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:13:14.562Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:13:14.562Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Can you do the job?

How does any of this help the employer? How could asking about my greatest weakness matter?\n\nThe key to understanding this is realizing that they actually only care about the 3 Elemental questions. Regardless of what question you're asked or the puzzle you're tasked with it's all because the employer is seeking to answer \"Can you do the job?\", \"Will you do the job?\" or \"Are you annoying?\"\n\n## Convert difficult questions into the Elemental questions\nSince you know the employer just cares about the 3 Elemental questions you can convert the question they ask you into its Elemental form.\n\nFor example if you're asked \"What is your greatest weakness?\" you should rephrase the question in your head into its Elemental form. \"With your greatest weakness can you still do the job?\", \"With your greatest weakness wil you still do this job?\", \"Is your greatest weakness annoying to me?\".\n\nQuestions in this context are a lot easier to answer.\n\n## Don't get frustrated, you have leverage\nEven knowing about the Elemental questions it can be difficult and time consuming to get an offer, but don't give up. Companies are highly incentivized to hire someone, you can be that person.\n\nFinding a new employee is expensive. The employer is spending money, time, and energy to look through résumés, conduct phone screens, and interview. The company only gets value from an employee after they hire someone. All of this combines to demonstrate that companies are highly incentivized to hire a candidate.\n\nMost companies hate the job hiring process as much as the candidates! It's distracting, stressful, and they often don't understand what they're doing. Be a great candidate and they'll jump at the chance to hire you.\n\n## Strategies for each stage of the process\nThe rest of this site will give specific strategies and tips for your résumé, for phone screening, and for interviewing. You can follow them or not but remember the 3 Elemental questions are what really matter.","pageLinks":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"3Zo0t7mfoX8mxwkECPmkol","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:00:02.703Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:05:59.297Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /resume/","linkTitle":"Create a Résumé","href":"/resume/"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"4XNozP7qCwtT5QTgALYsEq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:00:37.347Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:05:25.108Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /phone-screen/","linkTitle":"The phone screen","href":"/phone-screen/"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"5RobzAHWYnEhUdDbJnV75k","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:01:08.437Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:06:06.110Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /interview/","linkTitle":"In person interviews","href":"/interview/"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"7396rmJdU6I7Z1eZj05V4K","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:01:28.937Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:05:52.096Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /follow-up/","linkTitle":"Follow Up","href":"/follow-up/"}}]}},"5tX5uTI5USjO1GprBRFynh":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"5tX5uTI5USjO1GprBRFynh","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:21:11.649Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:21:11.649Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"contentPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"How to get through a Phone Screen","summary":"The phone screen is a type of initial interview where an employer tries to ensure a candidate is worth bring in for a full interview.

They aren't trying to trick you, they are trying to spend as little time as possible to figure out if you're worth continueing to talk to.\n\n## Practice common technical questions\nOne of the most common aspects of a phone screen is to attempt to verify your technical abilities. It's much easier to lie on a résumé than in a conversation. Many times this leads employers to rely on \"gotcha\" questions, i.e. superficial questions which often don't reflect the real world. This is unfortunate but unavoidable.\n\nLook up common technical questions for your industry, practice answering them. If you're on a phone screen and don't know the answer to a question make sure to write it down and go back and practice it later.\n\n## Be professional and interesting\nBecause phone screen interviews are so short it's more important than ever to have a good first impression. Being prompt and talk clearly. Practice starting to answer immediately, regardless of if you know the answer.\n\nFor example, if you are asked \"This architetural position uses Revit, how do you prepare a site presentation in Revit?\". Assuming you don't know the answer, you don't want to answer \"I don't know.\" because they will assume you don't know anything. A better answer might be \"I worked with Revit at Company X doing this other thing, I'm not sure about preparing site presentations but I'm sure I could learn it quickly.\".\n\n## Ask about the job\nYou are screening the job too, so use this time to ask a few questions that help you understand the job better.\n\n","nextPageLink":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"5RobzAHWYnEhUdDbJnV75k","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:01:08.437Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:06:06.110Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /interview/","linkTitle":"In person interviews","href":"/interview/"}}}},"1DlG1BViOVuDDLBm9iXp5f":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"1DlG1BViOVuDDLBm9iXp5f","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:27:31.616Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:27:31.616Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"contentPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Follow up after an interview","summary":"You'll often need to follow up after an interview.

It's a stressful test, you're being judged by strangers who only have a basic understanding of your skills, and it's not something that's practiced very often. The Elemental system helps with all of this!\n\nInterviewing is like dancing, it's frustrating when you're bad but after you know the basics and practice it becomes fun.\n\n## Remember the 3 Elemental questions\nAll you have to do in an interview is answer the 3 Elemental questions, everything you do should be focused on that.\n\n## \"Tell me about yourself\"\nMost interviews start with this question so it's important to understand how to answer it.\n\nPretend they asked you \"Why should we hire you for this position?\". Your goal should be to summarize your experience and the reasons they should hire you. Don't be too wordy with your answer, it's just a starting point for the conversation.\n\nCome to the interview with this answer ready - write it out before hand. It should be 3-6 sentences and tell the interviewer what area your expertise is in.\n\n## A simple trick to answer any question: Stories\nA story here is a situation from your experiences in work (ideal), school, or anywhere in your life which demonstrates a good answer to one or more of the 3 Elemental Questions. \"Can you do the job?\", \"Will you do the job?\", and \"Are you annoying?\"\n\nA story can be used to answer any question. Because we know that interviewers are really trying to answer the 3 Elemental Questions if we answer with a story that addresses them it will be a successful answer.\n\n## An example Story\nLet's say you have a geat story about a time when you worked late to finish a hard task. This story addresses at least 2 Elemental questions - \"Can you do the job?\" because it was a hard task and you finished it, and \"Will you do the job?\" because you showed extra committment to getting the task finished. Let's see how you could answer two very different questions with this story.\n\nQuestion 1: \"What is your greatest weakness?\"\n\nYour answer: My biggest weakness is knowing when to ask for help, I used to be very dependent on working within a team. I've been getting better at that though, recently for example I ran in to a difficult task at work that was taking a long time. I stayed late and got it done though, I think finding a healthy balance between being a team player and being able to finish work yourself is important.\n\nQuestion 2: \"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\"\n\nYour answer: In 5 years I see myself in a more senior version of this position. I enjoy being challenged and see myself taking on more and more difficult tasks. For example I recently ran in to a difficult task at work that was taking a long time, I stayed late and finished it. Over the next 5 years those problems will become easier and so I'll be able to do even more challenging tasks going forward.\n\nThis is obviously a very simple example but I think demonstrates the approach.\n\n## How to prepare Stories\nPreparing your stories should be one of the biggest tasks before an interview. You should have at least 5 stories that cover the most important parts of your résumé and your stories together should answer all 3 Elemental Questions. Practice answering common interview questions with any and each of the stories, during the actual interview you can cycle through your stories natually.\n\n## Technical questions\nAny interview will include questions specific to the job. The interviewer is using them to guage your skill level, so a partial answer is better than \"I don't know\". When you're not sure talk about what you do know. Try to pivot to something you're more comfortable talking about.\n\nFor a simple example if you're asked \"How do you change a flat tire on a car?\" and you don't know, you could answer \"I haven't changed a flat tire before but I've replaced my car's oil\". You're demonstrating knowledge in the area of the question even if you don't know that specific answer.\n\n## Your questions for them\nStart a conversation, don't check a box.\n\nUse the \"First Date\" strategy - ask questions which let them talk about things they like.\n\n","nextPageLink":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"7396rmJdU6I7Z1eZj05V4K","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:01:28.937Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:05:52.096Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /follow-up/","linkTitle":"Follow Up","href":"/follow-up/"}}}},"7CFF9HISMCxUry2sXEaZd1":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"7CFF9HISMCxUry2sXEaZd1","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:19:09.256Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:19:09.256Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"contentPage"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"How to build a great Résumé","summary":"A great résumé is the starting point to successful interview, spend time making it good!

Managers will look at your résumé for (literally) 5 seconds, it needs to tell them something in that time.\n\nSecond use it to set the agenda during interviews. An interviewer will look over your resume for about 60 seconds. They'll ask you to give more detail about what they see, so your résumé should contain the things you want to talk about.\n\n## A Résumé must be skimmable\n95% of the people looking at your résumé are just going to skim over it. Hiring managers look at tons of résumés, it's not worth it to them to read everything in detail if 99% of the résumés are obviously not a match.\n\nThe résumé should be written with a heirarchy of detail. People don't read a résumé like they would a book - line by line, top to bottom. Instead they glance at the headlines, when they find something interesting they'll read it a bit closer.\n\nThere is artisty in formatting a résumé well, but some suggestions are to use headers, bold text, and whitespace to draw the readers eyes.\n\nAnother suggestion is to have each line of a description start with the \"first 4 words\" rule, where the first four words of each line should be understanding by themselves.\n\n## A conversation about your résumé should be a conversation about why you're great for the job.\nThe second use of your résumé is to be conversation starters during an interview.\n\nOften an interviewer will sit down having only a bare idea of who you are, they will instinctively use your résumé to drive the conversation.\n\nTherefore it's important your résumé lists the things you want to talk about - those things that highlight why you should be hired.\n\nIn other words, a common mistake with a résumé is to list too much information. If you list all the minute tasks then it'll be very unlikely they'll ask you about the best things.\n\n## It should be proofread\nOne of the best heuristics for if an employee is going to work out is number of errors on a résumé. Proofread your résumé, then have your friends proofread it, then your mom, then do it again yourself!\n\n## Try to keep it 1-2 pages long\nLength isn't all that important, but minimum of 1 full page and maximum of 2 pages are good guidelines. It's important to have enough length to be able to include all the industry buzzwords that might help and to have enough for an interview to talk about. A résumé that's too long might be taken as a sign that you're not able to be consise though, and the longer the résumé the more likely it will contain typos.","nextPageLink":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"g2morb38hekc"}},"id":"4XNozP7qCwtT5QTgALYsEq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2019-09-13T17:00:37.347Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T17:05:25.108Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"navLink"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"linkLocation":"homepage footer /phone-screen/","linkTitle":"The phone screen","href":"/phone-screen/"}}}}}
