# Element Interviewing
Zack Tillotson

## Description

A site describing my approach to interviewing using what I call the Element strategy. Foundationally it's based on the idea that you have to answer 3 Elemental questions to get a job offer.
1. Can you do the job?
2. Will you do the job?
3. Are you annoying?

The site content includes many tips and guidelines for the various aspects of job hunting, including building a résumé, conducting a phone screen, conducting in person interviews, and following up afterwards.

The site itself is intended to be fast & SEO optimized.

## Development

Configure your firebase application (on the firebase administration pages), then modify these configuration files with your module's information:

1. package.json
1. firebase.json

Then just modify the components in src/firebase/utils.js, src/Application/Page, and src/components/... with your application code!

```
yarn
yarn start
open http://localhost:8888/
```
